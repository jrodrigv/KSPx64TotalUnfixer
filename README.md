# KSPx64TotalUnfixer

  UI for https://github.com/cerebrate/x64-unfixer that also support bulk operation on a folder and subfolders, this way we can create a x64 Kerbal with all the mods enabled in one click!
  
  RUN:
  
  1.It is recommended to create a backup of your Kerbal Space Program\GameData
  2.Execute KSPx64TotalUnfixer.exe
  3.Click on Browse and select the the GameData folder
  4.Click on Unfix
  5.If the security warning appears uncheck "Always ask before opening this file" otherwise you are going to get this message for each dll, and you do not want that ;)
  
  Enjoy!
